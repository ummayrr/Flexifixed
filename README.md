Since FlexStudent's "Remember Me" option never works, this project tries to solve the frustration of filling in Roll Number and Password, along with Captcha everytime you try to access the Student Portal.
Additional functionality of Redirecting you to a selected default page: Home, Marks, Transcript or Attendance is also added to save you a few clicks.

As you can see, shown and described in the image, you have to Enter your Roll Number and Password into the extension, which will all be stored locally on your device, you have the option to delete aswell!

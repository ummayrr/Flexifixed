Since FlexStudent's "Remember Me" option never works, this project tries to solve the frustration of filling in Roll Number and Password, along with Captcha everytime you try to access the Student Portal.
Additional functionality of Redirecting you to a selected default page: Home, Marks, Transcript or Attendance is also added to save you a few clicks.

As you can see, shown and described in the image, you have to Enter your Roll Number and Password into the extension, which will all be stored locally on your device, you have the option to delete aswell!

## If you're on Android

There's a workaround which is not that solid. Kiwi Browser on Android supports extensions, with some tweaks, it can be set to be treated as a standalone Flex app.

The captcha workaround is not 100% proof, and you have to solve the captcha manually on some connections, for example University WiFis. On your own connections it will work almost always.
